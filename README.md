# Web-based Wordle Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the popular Wordle game using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No external frameworks or libraries are used, keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to understand.

## Files

The files in this repository are organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game and links necessary scripts and styles.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for the styling and layout of the game interface.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the logic of the Wordle game, handling user interactions, word validation, and result computation.

## Getting Started

To play the Wordle game:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahmoudadelaziz/Word-Masters.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports modern web standards.

## How to Play

The objective of Wordle is to guess the secret five-letter word. You have six attempts to guess the word correctly.

- Enter a five-letter word into the input field and submit your guess.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct and in the right position (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (gray).
- Use the feedback to refine your guesses and try to deduce the secret word within the given attempts.
